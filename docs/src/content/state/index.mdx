# State Architecture

State management is centered around Zustand stores in `src/lib/stores`.

## Source of Truth

- Existing narrative docs:
  - `docs/wiki/04-State/Zustand-Architecture.md`
  - `docs/wiki/04-State/Store-Analysis.md`
  - `docs/wiki/04-State/Persistence.md`

<Callout type="warning">
Some store domains overlap route domains (e.g. blog/projects/about), so ensure updates maintain shared invariants between admin and public pages.
